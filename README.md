# Automated-Data-Scraping
This project aims to automate basic login steps and visit lead inboxes on Indiamart. It clicks on each link and gets the data to an excel using pandas.

IndiaMART is an online business-to-business (B2B) marketplace based in India. It is one of the largest and most popular platforms that connect buyers and sellers in the country. IndiaMART has grown into a prominent e-commerce platform that enables businesses to discover, connect, and trade with each other.

Leads in Indiamart refers to potential business opportunities or prospects that express interest in a product or service offered by a seller on the platform. When a user searches for a specific product or service on IndiaMART, they may come across multiple listings of different suppliers. If they are interested in making a purchase or learning more about a particular seller's offering, they can submit their contact information and requirements to the seller through the platform. This submission of contact information and requirements is what is referred to as a "lead."

For sellers, leads are essential as they represent potential customers who have already shown an interest in their products or services. It allows sellers to initiate communication with potential buyers, understand their needs, and offer relevant information or quotations to close the deal.


The Challenge:
IndiaMART, being one of the largest B2B marketplaces, presents a wealth of opportunities for businesses. However, managing leads manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There was a pressing need for a tool that would automate the process, streamline lead management, and free up valuable time for more strategic activities.


The Solution:
Using the power of Python and Selenium, I crafted a sophisticated script that simplifies the entire lead management process. Here's how it works:

Automated Login Process: The script simulates a user login to IndiaMART, removing the hassle of repetitive manual logins.
Navigating to Leads Inbox: Once logged in, the script smoothly navigates to the leads inbox section, ready to capture the latest leads.
Scraping Lead Data: Employing Selenium's web scraping capabilities, the script intelligently extracts key information from each lead, including contact details, product requirements, and more.
Storing Data in Excel: The extracted lead data is organized and stored neatly in an Excel file, ensuring easy access and quick follow-ups.

⏱️ Time Saved, Productivity Boosted:
The impact of this automation cannot be understated. With this script in place, the hours previously spent manually managing leads have been drastically reduced. Now, I can concentrate on engaging with potential clients, providing tailored solutions, and fostering strong business relationships.
